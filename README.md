# 🚀 LeetCode Grind 💻  

Hey there, welcome to my LeetCode repository! 🎉  

This repo is where I dump (read: meticulously curate ✨) my solutions to LeetCode problems. Whether you're here for inspiration, to learn, or just to vibe, feel free to explore.  

## 📌 What’s Inside?  

- **Languages**: Primarily **Java**, with occasional appearances by other languages if I’m feeling adventurous.  
- **Problem Categories**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP—you name it.    

## 🎯 Why This Repo?  

1. **Practice**: Solving problems one line of code at a time.  
2. **Share & Learn**: Collaborate and learn from others (yes, you’re welcome to PR 👀).  
3. **Track Progress**: Watch me go from "what even is recursion?" to "is this optimal enough?"  

## 🛠️ How It Works  

- Each solution is categorized by problem type and difficulty.  
- Filenames are based on LeetCode problem titles, so you can search easily.   

## 🚦 Status  

**Still grinding.** 🐢 Slow and steady wins the race, right?
